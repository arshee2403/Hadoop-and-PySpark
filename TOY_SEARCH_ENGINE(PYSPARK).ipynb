He left his third-floor bedroom and began\\nlooking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and \\nchecking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    \\ncompound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.\\n   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them\\nwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the \\nsix said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    \\nsince Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's \\nphone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the\\ncults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.\\n    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel\\ncompound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD\\nmeanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the\\nwomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all\\nunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    \\nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\\nit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.\\nHundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling\\nthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than\\nthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,\\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \\nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \\npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\\nother flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked \\ntogether with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's\\nescaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others\\ndied groping in the blackness.\\n\\nFrank\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
